		<h1>The HTML5 Document Outline: What I Learned</h1>

		<h2>Article 1: Document Outlines (via htmldoctor.com)</h2>

		<p>This article talked about how document outlines have changed from html4 to html5. Among other things, one really useful thing I took away from this article was the sectioning elements of section, article, aside, and nav. I did a little bit more research to find some examples of cases where each of them can be used. I also got a much better idea of imlpicit or implied sections. In html5, based on the article, it seems that even though it's possible to use headings of any rank within different sectioning elements, it's better to stick to either just h1's, or to use the proper heading rankings based on the nesting level of the sectioning element. Overall, I got a much better feel for the document outline from this article. </p>

		<h2> Article 2: HTML5 And The Document Outlining Algorithm (via smashingmagazine.com) </h2>

		<p>This article was helpful because it talked about a range of things relating to the document outline algorhythm, and spelled it all out in layman's terms which was helpful for a beginner like me. It helped me to fully understand iplicit sectioning by stating "Each heading creates its own implicit section, and any subsequent heading of a lower level starts another layer, of implicit sub-section, within it. An implicit section is ended by a heading of the same level or higher." It even illustrated this concept by providing a few examples. Another really useful thing I took away from this was that implicit sections can go within explicit sections. One example could be a section containing one h2 heading and three h3 headings. However, the opposite (explicit sections within implicit sections) can't be done, and would destroy an organized outline. <p>
