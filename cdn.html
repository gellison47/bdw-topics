		<p>A content delivery network is a huge network of servers that help websites in a variety of ways. It makes a site harder to attack, because it has a large quantity of servers that are able to absorb attack traffic. It also reduces load time of pages, and reduces costs associated with running a website. A large majority of applications, files, media, and social newtworks use a cdn to deliver their content.
		<p>Peer-to-peer CDN networks also have caught on. In these systems, users themselves also act as servers. It increases serving capacity as more users join the network.
