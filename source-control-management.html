			<p>This article discussed what version control is and how it works. Also known as a revision control system, it's essentially a collection (or repository) of files, which generally contain source code. Different people, depending on the access they have to a project, are view or make changes to the project, and those changes are tracked. The changes can also be reversed if a change is made that is unsatisfactory. Being able to know the what, who, and when of changes allows a more straightforward development process. Version control also allows us to coordinate teams of developers, so that people can work independently, unaffected by the changes that other people make. Only when the developers decide to commit or merge their changes will everyone be able to see those changes. Finally, it allows us to do our due diligence when it comes to intellectual property.</p>

			<p>Version control can be used with any type of file on a computer. Using a VCS (version control system) allows us to have a lot more flexibility when it comes to collaborative development. If things get really screwed up or files are lost, it's generally pretty easy to recover using a VCS. VCS's have historically gone through a progression from local VCS's that kept all changes in a database on the user's computer. From there, it moved to to a centralized VSC, which allowed everyone to know what other people involved with the project were doing. However, it was still error prone because everything was stored on a central server. To deal with this problem, distributed VCSs were created. Git is an example of a DVCS. Instead of checking the latest snapshot of the files on the central server, their computer actually fully mirrors the repository. It allows users to collaborate in different ways with people involved in a project. Workflows that were'nt possible with other VCSs can be created.</p>
