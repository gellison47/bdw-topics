		<p>Clearfix is a convenient way to contain floats without adding anything to the structural markup. Instead of adding a "clear:both" tag before the element's closing tag, the same thing can be done using css. In Internet Explorer, clearfix triggers a different construct/formatting than in other modern browsers, giving the element a layout.</p>

		<p>This article discusses the progression of how developers have adapted their code when attempting to clear floats. Originally, clear:both was used in the containing section. However, adding extra HTML markup for layout and positioning reasons is frowned upon by some, so Clearfix was introduced as a css feature. However, since older versions of IE don't support it, Micro clearfix was introduced. Basically, it's a newer method that works across all modern browsers. You add a small amount of css and set a class="cf" on the container section and it works the same as the previous methods with less headaches.</p>
