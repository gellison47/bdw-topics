		<p>There are five position properties:static, relative, absolute, fixed, and inherit. Each has its own purpose that allow you to create any layout you need, all using CSS. Elements normally inherit the static property, unless they have a different property added to them. Static simply means to follow the natural page flow. Each element will stack on top of one another. The relative property allows you to position elements as you wish, but doesn't affect the elements that follow. By using the absolute property, the element is removed from the normal page flow. It can't be affected by elements that come before or after. The fixed property makes the element stay in the same spot on the viewport. It doesn't scroll with the document and stays fixed.</p>
