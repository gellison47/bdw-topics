		<h1>HTML Semantics: What I Learned</h1>

		<h2>Article 1: Using Semantic HTML (via adobe.com)</h2>

		<p>I liked this article because it talked about the reasons why using semantic html is beneficial. In class, Richard pointed out that you should never use different headings merely because they provide the correct font size for whatever you're doing. This article elaborated on that, saying "Using an h1 element just to make text larger is the textbook example of nonsemantic HTML." This is an example of why it's important to use semantic html-it allows people, browsers, and search engines to easily understand the organization of content on the page. Put simply, html can be more easily understood through the use of semantics. It makes your content more accessible, optimizes your content for search engines, and makes everything easier for developers to understand. The author also points out that proper use of semantics can be a bit subjective, so while it's important to try to use proper semantics as much as possible, having perfect semantics is an unattainable goal, and therefore you should never kill yourself trying to get there.</p>

		<h2>Article 2: Let's Talk About Semantics (via html5doctor.com)</h2>

		<p>This article elaborated on the fact that html semantics are open to interpretation, and there tends to be some disagreement on the right ways to do certain things. However, most people agree that semantics are incredibly important. The problem, however, is that in the past many people often thought that a unique element is required for things that don't have a specific name, such as a comment. However, the article points out that it's important to look at the meaning of each element. "article isn&rsquo;t just for articles. That&rsquo;s the point. Note that its name is irrelevant here. It could be called pineapple &mdash; what matters is what it is defined to mean, not what its name is. And its definition is one that covers both articles and comments. They are both self-contained compositions." I really understood what the author was trying to say when he put it this way: "Don&rsquo;t think of article as a magazine article. Think of it as an article of clothing, an independent entity that can be arranged in conjunction with other articles of clothing, but is a complete thing in itself." The page I found also included a really helpful flowchart for understanding when to use different elements in html5. Instead of using the classic div element, it suggests the different situations in which using more accurate semantics is helpful. </p>
